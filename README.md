# Fun With FizzBuzz!

###### A small example of the FizzBuzz exercise using css logic to determine when to display Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or nothing, and adding a little style. In this example, Javascript is only used to create 100 list items and append them to an ordered list in the body.

### The Rules of FizzBuzz:

1. Create a numbered list from 1 - 100
2. If the number is divisble by 3 display "Fizz" (i.e. 3. Fizz)
3. If the number is divisble by 5 display "Buzz" (i.e. 5. Buzz)
4. If the number is divisble by 15 display "FizzBuzz" (i.e. 15. FizzBuzz)
5. If the number is not divisible by 3, 5, or 15 then only display the number (i.e. 2.)
